      <p> As someone who is interested in being a <b>User Experience/Interaction designer</b> as a future career it is important that my work addresses the needs and values of clients. I aim to work with underrepresented groups and help them be more succesful when their in situations that hold them back from reaching their full potential. I enjoy interviewing potential clients and also getting feedback on my designs from them and incorporating that into my revised solution to their problem. </p>

          <p>  One thing I want people to take away from my portfolio when they first land on it is that I am <span2><i>organized, have appealing asthetics, and design with purpose</span2></i>. Purposely, meaning that I deliberately use a certain color to appeal to my audience or added specific images in places that make sense and that would appeal to say a recruiter or professor looking at my site. The site should be pretty straight forward and user friendly. The user should be able to navigate their way around the website with ease.</p>
            
            <p> I would say that my three strongest skills would be <span2><i>incorporating aesthetics, brainstorming ideas for projects, and making various sketches</span2></i> for a design project. I have always been able to see which colors mesh well together. For example, I know which colors for texts would look good on what background like dark purple on a bright orange background would be easy to read and go well together because their halloween colors. For brainstorming, I have always used lists and drawings to make ideas. I have used pinterest, google, and instagram to name a few for inspiration when I am brainstorming. Sketching has always been easy for me when I am designing for a project. I first make quick sketches that don't have alot of detail on them and then I make revised sketches based on feedback from teachers, peers, and my target user group. The revised sketches are always more detailed and labeled so that whomever looks at it can easily understand my idea(s).  </p>

      <p> For this capstone project, I have a website that is still being developed and edited using Wix.com that I will be referencing in order to build this capstone project. It has a majority of my past design projects and work. I am going to use that for reference and also I have folders on my laptop that have images related to my past work and designs. I am going to incorporate all of those into my project so that it makes sense and represents my <span2><i>interests, work, and passion.<span2></i> </p>
